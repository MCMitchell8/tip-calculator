## Features

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are in progress:

## Notes
The most challenging part was getting used to the layout and all the settings that are possible. Also, it took me a while to make sure all the items were connected to the code correctly. Now that I figured out the basic elements, I am excited to continue working through the optional features to make this app more appealing.
